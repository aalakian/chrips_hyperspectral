## Classification of Hyperspectral Reflectance Images With Physical and Statistical Criteria : CHRIPS method (2020)

<div align="justify"> 
CHRIPS is a hierarchical unsupervised classification method that can be applied on hyperspectral reflectance images covering the spectral range [400â€“2500 nm]. For each class, a dedicated detection method exploits specific spectral properties (specific absorptions or shape features) or spectral indices. CHRIPS method identifies fourteen different classes that are gathered into four groups: dark surfaces, materials with specific absorptions, vegetation and other types of surfaces (scattering surfaces). The class assignment is hierarchical: classes are investigated one after the other in a given order. Class order is defined by the complexity of class characterization. It reduces the number of criteria needed to characterize each class.

The ordered classes are given by the following list:
*  Dark surface
   * dark green vegetation
   * water
   * unidentified dark surface (water, shadows...)
*  Material with specific absorptions
   * plastic matter (aliphatic)
   * plastic matter (aromatic)
   * carbonate
   * clay soil
*  Vegetation
   * dense green vegetation
   * sparse green vegetation
   * stressed vegetation
*  Classes with dedicated indices
   * house roof/tile/iron oxide
   * asphalt
   * vehicle/paint/metal surface
   * non-carbonated gravel
*  Unidentified (0)
